Hello! This is my solution to the 3-column preview card component challenge. This challenge is from frontend mentor to make practice on frontend skills.

### The Challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Features

- Used the :root pseudo-class to declare global CSS variables
- used rem unit to make relative font-size to the root element
- Named as BEM (Block\_\_Elemenet-Modifier) to write cleaner and more readable CSS classes
- Used the Semantic HTML to make search engines, screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of web content.
- To make it nicer added basic animation and hovers.
- Added Focus-visible to navigate with TAB
